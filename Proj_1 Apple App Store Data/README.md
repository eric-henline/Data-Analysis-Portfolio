Capstone 1 - Recommendations for App Developers to Maximize Success on the Apple App Store

Objective: Analyzing data from over 189,000 apps featured on the App Store in 2020, determine the characteristics of the highest-rated apps to inform potential developers what types of apps to make in order to increase their chances of making a successful app 

Tools: Excel for cleaning data, Tableau for data visualizations and story-telling

Summarized Outcomes: Reference (i.e. maps, dictionary) and Game apps are the highest rated, but Game apps are much more common (67% of all highly-rated apps).  95% of highly rated apps are free to download, but pricing apps at <$3 or in $5 intervals is a good strategy, while Music apps can demand higher download prices.
