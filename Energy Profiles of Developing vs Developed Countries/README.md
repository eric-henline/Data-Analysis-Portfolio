Capstone 2 - Energy Consumption Profiles of Developing vs Developed Countries from 1965-2019

Objective: Determine how the 4 largest developing (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and the 4 largest developed (Japan, UK, US, Germany) compare against each other in their reliance on and overall consumption of the different forms of energy.

Tools: Python and Jupyter Notebooks for cleaning data, Tableau for data visualizations and story-telling

Outcomes: Fossil Fuels dominate energy share (>75%) in all countries except Brazil (54%).  Developing countries are more reliant on Coal and Hydro while Developed countries are more reliant on Oil, Natural Gas, and Nuclear.  China and its huge population consume the most energy overall, followed by the US, but China's consumption continues to grow at high rates across all energy sources.
